	abstract = {We present ilastik, an easy-to-use interactive tool that brings machine-learning-based (bio)image analysis to end users without substantial computational expertise. It contains pre-defined workflows for image segmentation, object classification, counting and tracking. Users adapt the workflows to the problem at hand by interactively providing sparse training annotations for a nonlinear classifier. ilastik can process data in up to five dimensions (3D, time and number of channels). Its computational back end runs operations on-demand wherever possible, allowing for interactive prediction on data larger than {RAM}. Once the classifiers are trained, ilastik workflows can be applied to new data from the command line without further user interaction. We describe all ilastik workflows in detail, including three case studies and a discussion on the expected performance.},

	abstract = {Spatially resolved omics technologies are transforming our understanding of biological tissues. However, the handling of uni- and multimodal spatial omics datasets remains a challenge owing to large data volumes, heterogeneity of data types and the lack of flexible, spatially aware data structures. Here we introduce {SpatialData}, a framework that establishes a unified and extensible multiplatform file-format, lazy representation of larger-than-memory data, transformations and alignment to common coordinate systems. {SpatialData} facilitates spatial annotations and cross-modal aggregation and analysis, the utility of which is illustrated in the context of multiple vignettes, including integrative analysis on a multimodal Xenium and Visium breast cancer study.},
